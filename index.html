<h2><font face="Arial,Helvetica" color="black">Introduction</h2>

  Are you an early career researcher working in the field of ultrafast chemistry? Then the
  Young Scientist Symposium, 2021 is the right platform for you to disseminate your work
  and to find out what the experts of this research area have in mind!
  <br>
    <br>
  The Young Scientist Symposium, 2021 is organized by the AttoChem Network for fostering
  experimental and theoretical efforts to exploit the enormous potential of attosecond techniques in
  chemistry. The focus will be on the recent works of emerging early career scientists related to  ultrafast chemistry. This will be accompanied by plenary talks and panel discussions on the state-
  of-the-art developments and challenges of this area and the intersection of experiment and theory by leading scientists.
    <br>
    <br>
  There is both the possibility to give an oral talk or to present a poster.
    <br>
    <br>
  The conference will be held completely online during 14th-17th September, 2021.
  Registration is free of cost.

  <!-- and is open until 15th August, 2021 (5pm CET).
  The accepted presenters will be notified by 23rd August, 2021.
